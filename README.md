# SABR_Level3_Final

Although Marcel did provide a relatively accurate projection, there are a few items that should be considered in further evaluation. First, the weights are more arbitrary numbers than true indicators of how much predictability impact each previous season OPS was. Secondly, we have better ways to measure luck rather than bringing the measure of OPS closer to the average as Marcel had (I plan on attempting to beat Marcel again using StatCast data and quantifying luck by developing a classification model to determine how many hits the player had based on the exit velocity, spin rate, spin direction, etc. that should not have been hits based off probability in my next project). Finally, with advances in sport science, players are not regressing until later in careers, with many players now playing well into their 30s at high levels.

 To beat Marcel, I found the weights for each of previous three seasons OPS and their predictability power on OPSY4. I did this utilizing a linear regression model. I did not include the step of splitting the data into a train-test split due to nature of assignment. Once the model was created, I obtained the slope and coefficients, and created a column for the modelâ€™s OPS (BETTER_THAN_MARCEL) by the slope-intercept equation.  Finally, I confirmed to have had a lower incidence of both RMSE and MSE as compared to Marcel.
